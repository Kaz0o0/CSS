    The element Selectors
        you can select entire elements eg: h1, p , title
        this applies to all elements with the selected tag
        its lowest ranking for specificity

            p {
                color: red;
            }

    The class Selectors
        used to slecet elements with a certian class
        can be used on any elemenet with the class

            .aclass {
                color: blue;
            }

    the ID Selectors
        with certainid names'
        it can only be used on one elemenet at a time and is selected
        with the # symbol, however it is posible to use more than once

                #sometext {
                    color: orange;

                then theres id
                then inline styling at the top

introduction to types of units

        absolute units
                cm, mm, inches

        relative units
                they can be useful for scalling in different size screens
                    percentages
                    em  :  is 2em doubles base font size.

        special units
            pixels
                    technically an absolute unit but it scales. small pohone is okay, but if 2k or 4k then a 400px image is small.
                    px :
                    pt : a bit bigger than a pixel
                    pc : alot bigger than a pixel 1pc = 12 pt

        style tags
            70 vw: 70 x 1% of viewport width
