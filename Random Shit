Selectors
    grabbing and manipulating html

    The element Selectors
        you can select entire elements eg: h1, p , title
        this applies to all elements with the selected tag
        its lowest ranking for specificity

            p {
                color: red;
            }

    The class Selectors
        used to slecet elements with a certian class
        can be used on any elemenet with the class

            .aclass {
                color: blue;
            }

    the ID Selectors
        with certainid names
        it can only be used on one elemenet at a time and is selected
        with the # symbol, however it is posible to use more than once

                #sometext {
                    color: orange;
                }

                Headers are least
                then theres class
                then theres id
                then inline styling at the top
